subtitle: From astrophysics to software engineer

Hello! My name is Bri. I'm a classically trained astrophysicist who studied black holes and other extremely compact phenomena using numerical simulations and X-ray observations. After getting my PhD in Astronomy from the University of Virginia, I left academia and became a research software engineer. I currently work on projects funded by the Department of Energy.
